CargoMate Cetem SL is built on a heritage of more than three decades in international road transportation. Our family has been active in the sector since 1991, developing deep operational expertise and a reputation for reliability across European routes, with a strong specialization in tautliner transport services.

Founded as a second-generation initiative, CargoMate represents the evolution of that legacy. The company was created to combine established industry know-how with a younger, technology-driven perspective integrating digital tools, modern workflows, and data centric decision making into every aspect of the operation.

Our mission is to deliver efficient, transparent, and dependable transport solutions while upholding the values that shaped our first generation: commitment, integrity, and operational excellence. CargoMate aims not only to grow as an independent company but also to contribute to the long-term development of the broader family business ecosystem.

We operate with the mindset of a modern logistics partner—agile, adaptable, and focused on continuous improvement while relying on more than 30 years of experience moving goods safely and efficiently across borders through tautliner based road transport.
