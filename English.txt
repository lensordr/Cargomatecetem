CargoMate Cetem SL is built on a heritage of more than three decades in international road transportation. Our family has been active in the sector since 1991, developing a deep operational expertise and a reputation for reliability across European routes.

Founded as a second-generation initiative, CargoMate represents the evolution of that legacy. The company was created to combine established industry know-how with a younger, technology-driven perspective—integrating digital tools, modern workflows, and data-centric decision-making into every aspect of the operation.

Our mission is to deliver efficient, transparent, and dependable transport solutions while building on the values that shaped our first generation: commitment, integrity, and operational excellence. CargoMate aims not only to grow as an independent company but also to strengthen the long-term development of the broader family business ecosystem.

We operate with the mindset of a modern logistics partner—agile, adaptable, and focused on continuous improvement—while staying grounded in more than 30 years of experience moving goods safely and efficiently across borders.
